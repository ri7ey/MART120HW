CLI vs GUI is a comparison of two programs that do similar yet dramatically different forms of coding. On one hand CLI is a hard to use, straight to the point program but GUI is the opposite. Easy to use, adaptive coding and errors can be avoided? It sounds like two completely different things but both reach the same goal. The GUI seems to focus on more interface and  landscape aspect whereas the CLI is more of an objective and motion defining program. As someone that doesn't know much about coding it seems like a yin and yang combination.
I read that one of the trickiest things of CLI is that you are unable to modify or change appearance. GUI is also a slower system and can't be used without keyboard and mouse. On the other end CLI is keyboard only and a fast paced system. In CLI you can script a series of commands and in GUI you can only perform one command at a time. In CLI you get everything in a script but in GUI you can be visually active and see what you are doing. For someone like me it sounds like from reviews that GUI is going to be easier to use than CLI so I'll have to work twice as hard to understand and get a hold of CLI.
